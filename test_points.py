#eoracle has a points system, this system gives points (aka credit) to operators, stakers how locked their restaked ETH on eoracle.
# Operator is an entity (represented by an address in ethereum) that registerd to EigenLayer and then to eoracle as oeprator. Operators operate the eoracle protocol by running the software.
# Stakers are entities (represented by addresses in etheruem) who have money (ETH, LSTs, â€¦) and the delegate the money to operators. 
# The points system credit the operators and stakers by the amount of money that they staked on eoracle.
# A Staker receives 1 point per hour based on the 1 ETH that was delegated to operator(s) that are registered to eoracle
# An Operator receives 1 points per hour based on 3% of the total ETH that was delegated to it by stakers.
# The points system is live and can be seen here - https://eo.app
# The points system has a backend process that runs every 10 minutes and collect the list of operators, and stakers (by looking on delegation and undelegation events) and calculate the total points to these addresses 
# The point system has also an api that one can use and get the points to a specific address https://eo.app/api/v1/points/<address>
